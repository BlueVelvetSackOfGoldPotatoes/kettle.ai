          <p class="lead">Hey! My name is Gonçalo and his is Sander. I am a MSc student of Artificial Intelligence at Groningen
          university and Sander is finishing his BSc on AI as well. We want to take what we know from AI as a
          scientific field and teach it to anyone that wants to learn how to program while improving their own
          cognitive capacities. Basically, we want to make you smarter using science. So we've created an educational
          package and called it delta AI or Δ-AI for short. You can hire us to teach it to you, your kids, your company - anyone!</p>

                    <p class="lead">Δ-AI is a novel educational package aimed at teaching anyone how to program while educating you in a more general sense in Science.</p>
          
                    <p class="column-text">The information from the scientific field of AI can be used as a tool to teach students
                      about learning and thinking in general: simultaneously introducing how the brain works and how to think
                      better. All of this while teaching people the
                      languages of the future: programming languages. The trifecta-AI approach, or Δ-AI, is then designed considering well established cognitive
                      facts, learning-theory
                      and Artificial Intelligence. The field of AI studies intelligence and
                      knowledge in
                      a very general sense. The underlying theory of the field is invaluable to any person that wants to learn
                      anything. As an educational architecture, Δ-AI reverts back to basics. Before anyone is taught anything they
                      should be taught
                      what it means to learn, how the brain learns and what are the optimal learning strategies - this is the virtue
                      behind Δ-AI: knowing how things can be known. This means subjects like Computational Theory, Logic,
                      Mathematics and Programming
                      are intentionally emphasised in the material. An applied flavour of these fields is taught explicitly as a
                      tool to tackle real life problems by explicitly teaching student's how their own brains work. This is also
                      made possible through
                      incentivising critical thinking (i.e. the analysis of available facts, evidence, observations, and arguments
                      to form a reasonable judgment).</p>

                      <p class="lead">We are a group of Artificial Intelligence graduates and our aim is to take what we know from AI as a scientific field, learning theory, the human brain as well as computer science and teach it to anyone that wants to learn it. Basically, teaching you how to program while improving your own cognitive capacities. We want to make you smarter using science. So we've created an educational package and called it delta AI, or Δ-AI for short. You can hire us to teach it to you, your kids, your company - anyone!
